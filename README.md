---
## Susanna Edens | October 30, 2017


#### Playing around with network layer parameters:
- error rate probability
- packet loss probability
- RTT
- How is protocol affected?

##### for both protocols:
- how does it handle timeout? duplicate data/ack? corrupted data?
- the pros/cons of each protocol.
- under what network behaviour/status would you choose this protocol over the other


### STOP AND GO
- the alg
- how implemented
- pros/cons (when you would want to use this protocol)

### GO BACK N
- the alg
- how implemented
- pros/cons


### Addt'l notes
- ...
